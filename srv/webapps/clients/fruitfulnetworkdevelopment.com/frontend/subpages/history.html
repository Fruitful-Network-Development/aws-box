              <h2>Cleveland’s Greenhouse Industry</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="dossier-history__lead">
              <p>From the late 19th century through the mid‑20th century, Greater
                Cleveland became the “Greenhouse Capital of America.” Martin Ruetenik
                built the first greenhouse in Brooklyn Heights in 1885, and by the
                mid‑1920s about 50 businesses maintained 80 acres of greenhouses,
                growing tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers. The industry expanded to
                400 acres under glass by the early 1960s, employing roughly 1,000
                hothouse farmers—many of them Puerto Rican migrants. Produce was sold
                through roadside stands, markets, and the Northern Ohio Food Terminal,
                enabling restaurants and households to enjoy fresh vegetables
                year‑round. Cheap coal made heating affordable early on, but rising
                energy costs, pollution, and competition from Canadian greenhouses in
                the 1970s led to decline.</p>

                <h3>Rise and Decline</h3>
                <p>Greenhouse farming was labour‑intensive and expensive, requiring
                  misting systems, boiler‑heated steam pipes, and careful pollination.
                  The R.O. Apelt Sons operation grew to 3.5 acres by 1959 but
                  dismantled its greenhouse in 2016, illustrating the sector’s
                  collapse. Many operators switched to flowers or closed entirely as
                  Canadian subsidies tilted the market.</p>

                  <p>The Northern Ohio Food Terminal opened in June 1929 on a 34‑acre
                    site and once housed 100 merchants, employing about 1,500 people
                    and handling roughly $140 million worth of food annually. During
                    the late 1950s and early 1960s the terminal distributed nearly $200
                    million in produce each year, making it a vital organizing hub for
                    regional agriculture. Produce arrived via railcars and trucks and
                    moved quickly to wholesalers and retailers.</p>

                      produce backed by safety and quality programs. The company
                      distributes local, organic, and specialty produce to grocery
                      stores and warehouses, supports local growers by purchasing their
                      products, and operates a 25,000‑square‑foot certified organic
                      facility.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Parker Bosley, often called the “grandfather of Cleveland’s local
                food,” grew up on a dairy farm and studied cooking in Paris before
                opening Parker’s New American Bistro. Over two decades he built a menu
                that relied exclusively on foods produced by Ohio and nearby
                Pennsylvania farmers. His menu changed daily to reflect what was in
                season, and he visited farms to encourage specific varieties and
                breeds.</p>
              <div class="dossier-history__callout dossier-history__callout--accent">
                <h3>Fair Prices &amp; Farmer Relationships</h3>
                <p>Bosley cultivated a network of cheese producers and small farms,
                  paying farmers a premium (e.g., $10 per pound for artisan cheese) to
                  ensure profits flowed directly back to them. He championed
                  small‑scale, sustainable farming and challenged the notion that
                  cheap food should come at the expense of natural resources and rural
                  economies. His advocacy laid the groundwork for Cleveland’s
                  farm‑to‑table movement.</p>

              <h2>Food Terminals &amp; Produce Auctions</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="dossier-history__columns">
              <div>
                <p>In the early 20th century, food terminals were the primary organizing
                  facet of local agriculture. Cleveland once hosted seven or eight
                  terminals, relying on local farms to supply these bustling hubs.
                  Produce trains from the West Coast—called “fruit blocks”—traveled
                  east with perishable goods that often had priority over passenger
                  trains. The Pennsylvania Railroad Fruit Auction &amp; Sales Building
                  in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, constructed in 1926, stretched
                  about 1,533 feet long (roughly five city blocks). This massive
                  warehouse allowed farmers and brokers to unload railcars directly
                  into auction bays where fruit and produce were sold at dawn. Auctions
                  began early so goods could reach stores and restaurants by opening
                  time, a logistical rhythm that kept regional food systems running.</p>
                <p>These terminals thrived thanks to the proximity of rail lines, but as
                  refrigerated trucking became widespread, rail‑based produce
                  distribution declined. Many terminals were demolished or repurposed;
                  only a handful of operations, like the Northern Ohio Food Terminal
                  (now Sanson Company) and the Consumers Produce facility in
                  Pittsburgh, remain today. The history underscores how infrastructure
                  shaped regional food economies and how transportation innovations can
                  shift the balance between local and industrial supply chains.</p>
