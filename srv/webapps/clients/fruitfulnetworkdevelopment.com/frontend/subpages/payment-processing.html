              <h2>§ Payment Processing Overview</h2>
              <p class="intro-text">At Fruitful Network Development, we provide a simple, reliable payment foundation for community‑driven enterprises. Whether you’re raising funds for farm infrastructure under a fiscal sponsorship program or selling produce at market, our unified platform brings online donations, designated giving, and point‑of‑sale transactions together under one trusted nonprofit account.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3>Trusted Payment Processing</h3>
                <p>We recommend PayPal for most small organizations because it balances low-friction setup with donor familiarity and robust transaction reporting. A single account can support multiple designated projects while maintaining clear separation in your internal records.</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                  <li><strong>Fast onboarding:</strong> quick setup and a familiar donor experience.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reliable records:</strong> exportable transaction data for audit-ready bookkeeping.</li>
                  <li><strong>Donor confidence:</strong> recognized checkout flows that improve completion rates.</li>
                  <li><strong>Flexible routing:</strong> one sponsor account supports many designated projects.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Designed for Fiscal Sponsorship</h3>
                <p>In a fiscal sponsorship model, all donations are legally made to the sponsor nonprofit. Our payment setup centralizes donation intake under the sponsor’s EIN while still capturing each donor’s <em>designation intent</em> (e.g., “Farm Infrastructure Fund”). This preserves tax‑deductibility and ensures donors know their gift supports the right project.</p>
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> designations express donor intent; the sponsor retains final authority over all funds and must publish policies detailing how restricted funds are managed.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>POS &amp; In‑Person Flexibility</h3>
                <p>Our solution can integrate in-person payment acceptance (such as market‑day sales) with online donations, unifying reporting across all channels. This helps projects that blend digital fundraising with onsite community engagement.</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                  <li><strong>Unified reporting:</strong> align market transactions with online contributions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Scalable workflows:</strong> consistent processes across farms, events, and projects.</li>
                  <li><strong>Clear separation:</strong> keep retail sales and charitable donations distinct when necessary.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Donation Box Module</h3>
                <p>We build a lightweight “donation box” widget that embeds seamlessly in your websites. This module routes donations through PayPal while capturing donor metadata (designation, comments, email) and automating receipt workflows. It can be reused across multiple project sites, supporting aggregated reporting at the sponsor level.</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                  <li><strong>Consistent UI:</strong> a branded donation widget for all sponsored projects.</li>
                  <li><strong>Metadata capture:</strong> collect designation intent and donor details.</li>
                  <li><strong>Automated receipts:</strong> send acknowledgements and maintain audit trails.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Contingencies &amp; Alternatives</h3>
                <p>While PayPal is often the fastest way to launch, our architecture allows you to switch processors or support ACH, recurring gifts, or special events. We design the donation box so the payment processor can be replaced without rebuilding your fundraising flows.</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                  <li><strong>Processor fallback:</strong> route payments through an alternate provider if needed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Expanded methods:</strong> optional ACH, recurring contributions, or event‑specific integrations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Accounting alignment:</strong> configurable exports and tagging to match your bookkeeping.</li>
                  <li><strong>Separation of concerns:</strong> payments are handled by the processor; program data lives in your system.</li>
                </ul>

              <h2>Fiscal Sponsorship Programs</h2>
              <p class="digression-lede">A structure that allows mission‑aligned projects to fundraise compliantly under a sponsor nonprofit, while preserving donor deductibility and maintaining clear financial oversight.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="digression-text-grid">
              <div>
                <h3>What Fiscal Sponsorship Is</h3>
                <p>Fiscal sponsorship is an arrangement where a recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit (the <strong>sponsor</strong>) accepts charitable donations and manages funds on behalf of a mission‑aligned project that is not its own standalone charity. All donations are legally made to the sponsor, who retains full control and responsibility for how the funds are used.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Donations flow to the sponsor:</strong> processed under the sponsor’s EIN and payment accounts.</li>
                  <li><strong>Projects receive support:</strong> via sponsor‑managed spending or documented regrants.</li>
                  <li><strong>Compliance built in:</strong> sponsor oversight, reporting, and policy control.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Why It Matters for Farms &amp; Community Projects</h3>
                <p>Many farms and grassroots initiatives have public‑benefit goals but cannot access traditional capital or charitable fundraising on their own. Fiscal sponsorship makes it possible to raise funds for infrastructure, education, conservation, or access programs while keeping donations tax‑deductible and properly governed.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>How We Support Sponsors &amp; Projects</h3>
                <p>We treat fiscal sponsorship as both a governance framework and a technical system. We help sponsors and project leads establish clear policies, predictable workflows, and clean reporting so fundraising is simple for donors and manageable for administrators.</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list">
                  <li><strong>Program definition:</strong> determine eligible projects, expenses, and required documentation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Donor experience:</strong> build donation pages that state the sponsor as the recipient and capture designation intent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fund controls:</strong> tag restricted/designated funds, implement approval workflows, and maintain audit‑ready records.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disbursement pathways:</strong> support direct vendor payment or reimbursement/grants with documentation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Back‑end integration:</strong> export or sync donation and expense data into bookkeeping categories and dashboards.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Governance &amp; Transparency</h3>
                <p>Transparency is essential: donors must know they are giving to the sponsor, projects must understand how funds are managed, and sponsors must maintain consistent oversight. We help clients publish required language, adopt internal policies, and maintain reporting that satisfies boards, auditors, and funders.</p>
                <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> donors may express intent, but the sponsor must retain final decision authority and ensure all spending aligns with charitable purpose and policy.</p>
                <div class="dossier-editorial-body">
                  <div class="dossier-editorial-callout dossier-editorial-callout--accent">
                    <h3>Unrestricted Donations</h3>
                    <p>These gifts support the sponsor’s overall mission without any designated project. They provide flexibility for the sponsor to allocate resources where they are most needed.</p>
                    <ul class="dash-list">
                      <li>Used for general operations or broad mission objectives.</li>
                      <li>Not tied to a particular project, but still aligned with the charity’s purpose.</li>
                      <li>Tracked in the aggregate and reported in organizational financials.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <div class="dossier-editorial-callout dossier-editorial-callout--accent">
                    <h3>Restricted Donations</h3>
                    <p>Donors may express an intention to support a specific program or project. We tag those funds internally for that purpose and report them separately, while the sponsor retains ultimate authority over how they are spent.</p>
                    <ul class="dash-list">
                      <li>Donor intent guides spending, but the sponsor controls disbursement.</li>
                      <li>Requires clear policy language describing how designations are handled.</li>
                      <li>Separate bookkeeping tracks donations and expenses for each purpose.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div class="dossier-editorial-callout dossier-editorial-callout--accent">
                    <h3>Conditional Donations</h3>
                    <p>Some gifts come with conditions that must be met before the sponsor may use them—such as a matching requirement or a construction milestone. Until the conditions are satisfied, the funds are held in trust.</p>
                    <ul class="dash-list">
                      <li>Conditions are explicitly stated and documented between donor and sponsor.</li>
                      <li>Funds are recognized when conditions are fulfilled; otherwise they may be returned or reallocated.</li>
                      <li>Helps ensure accountability for donors and compliance for the sponsor.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Supporting Multiple Projects</h3>
                <p>When multiple farms or teams operate under one sponsor, we structure the program so each project can fundraise through the same system while still producing clean, separated reporting. This allows coordinated fundraising across a network without sacrificing accountability.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Per‑project pages:</strong> each project has its own public page and donation designations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Per‑project reporting:</strong> summaries by project, designation, and spending category.</li>
                  <li><strong>Consistent controls:</strong> sponsor rules apply uniformly across all projects.</li>
                </ul>
