      <div style="flex:1 1 300px;">
        <p>The Oberlin Food Hub is a nonprofit founded in 2017 to build an efficient, equitable regional food system.  It supports sustainable agriculture and small- and mid‑size producers while ensuring consistent access to healthy, affordable food for communities.  The hub offers a centralized ordering platform and manages logistics—aggregation, cold storage, invoicing and customer service—so farmers can focus on growing food.  It purchases products from area farms and supplies them to food banks, independent grocers, colleges, restaurants and farm stores.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Equity Focus</h3>
          <p>By pooling supply from many small farms and handling logistics centrally, the Food Hub creates fair market access for growers who might otherwise struggle to reach wholesale buyers.  The organization emphasizes fairness, transparency and shared prosperity; it plans to expand services with a shared‑use kitchen incubator to process Grade B produce and build climate resilience.</p>

    <h2>Rosby Companies</h2>
    <!-- Layout: single column with subcards for each operation (agriculture & recycling). -->
    <p>Rosby Companies operate an agricultural, horticultural and recycling business on a scenic 70‑acre site in Brooklyn Heights near Cleveland.  They produce their own soils, mulches, organic humus and compost, and run a resource recycling program that reclaims construction and demolition debris from the waste stream.  The operation integrates farming with environmental stewardship by turning waste into inputs for local growers.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Waste‑to‑Value Model</h3>
      <p>The company’s composting facility returns organic matter to the soil while diverting material from landfills.  By producing mulches and humus locally, Rosby Companies reduce the need for imported soil amendments and support circular nutrient cycles within the regional food system.</p>

  <!-- Cleveland Greenhouse Industry Card -->
  <section class="info_card">
    <h2>Cleveland’s Greenhouse Industry (Historical)</h2>
    <!-- Layout: timeline subsection to convey historical growth and decline. -->
    <p>From the late 19th century through the mid‑20th century, Greater Cleveland became the “Greenhouse Capital of America.”  Martin Ruetenik built the first greenhouse in Brooklyn Heights in 1885, and by the mid‑1920s about 50 businesses maintained 80 acres of greenhouses, growing tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers.  The industry expanded to 400 acres under glass by the early 1960s, employing roughly 1,000 hothouse farmers—many of them Puerto Rican migrants.  Produce was sold through roadside stands, markets and the Northern Ohio Food Terminal, enabling restaurants and households to enjoy fresh vegetables year‑round.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Rise and Decline</h3>
      <p>Greenhouse farming was laborious and expensive, requiring misting systems, boiler‑heated steam pipes and careful pollination.  Cheap coal initially made heating affordable, but rising energy costs and pollution in the 1960s and 1970s, coupled with competition from Canadian subsidized greenhouse producers, led to a rapid decline.  Many greenhouses closed or switched to flowers and ornamental plants.  The R.O. Apelt Sons operation, once a 3.5‑acre hothouse producing cucumbers, dismantled its greenhouse in 2016 after switching to hydroponic cucumbers in 2000.</p>

    <h2>Northern Ohio Food Terminal & Sanson Company</h2>
    <!-- Layout: highlight historical statistics then modern operations. -->
    <p>The Northern Ohio Food Terminal opened in June 1929 on a 34‑acre site and once housed 100 merchants, employing about 1,500 people and handling roughly $140 million worth of food annually.  During the late 1950s and early 1960s the terminal distributed nearly $200 million in produce each year, making it a vital organizing hub for regional agriculture.  Produce arrived via railcars and trucks and moved quickly to wholesalers and retailers.</p>

    <h2>Rust Belt Riders</h2>
    <!-- Layout: story narrative with call‑out for regulatory challenges. -->
    <p>Rust Belt Riders is a Cleveland‑based service that collects organic waste from restaurants and redistributes it to local farms and gardens as fertilizer.  The company began with co‑founders Daniel Brown and Michael Robinson riding a bicycle with a trailer to pick up food scraps from restaurants.  By turning waste into compost, they close the loop between urban eateries and regional farms.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Scaling Up Through Policy & Partnership</h3>
      <p>Composting at scale required a Class II composting permit and a suitable site.  Rust Belt Riders worked with the Ohio EPA to expand the exemption for community compost piles from 300 to 500 square feet, enabling more gardens to compost legally.  They later partnered with Kurtz Brothers to secure the Cloverleaf Composting Facility, allowing them to produce more compost in one month than they previously could in a year.  Their potting mixes have been ranked among the best in research trials, and they were named Best Small‑Scale Composter in the U.S.</p>

    <h2>Parker Bosley – Cleveland’s Local Food Pioneer</h2>
    <!-- Layout: narrative with highlighted quotes. -->
    <p>Parker Bosley, often called the “grandfather of Cleveland’s local food,” grew up on a dairy farm and studied cooking in Paris before opening Parker’s New American Bistro.  Over two decades he built a menu that relied exclusively on foods produced by Ohio and nearby Pennsylvania farmers.  His menu changed daily to reflect what was in season, and he visited farms to encourage specific varieties and breeds.</p>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Fair Prices & Farmer Relationships</h3>
      <p>Bosley cultivated a network of cheese producers and small farms, paying farmers a premium (e.g., $10 per pound for artisan cheese) to ensure profits flowed directly back to them.  He championed small‑scale, sustainable farming and challenged the notion that cheap food should come at the expense of natural resources and rural economies.  His advocacy laid the groundwork for Cleveland’s farm‑to‑table movement.</p>

  <!-- Food Terminals & Produce Auctions (Historic) Card -->
  <section class="info_card">
    <h2>Food Terminals & Produce Auctions (Historic)</h2>
    <!-- Layout: description of rail‑based distribution and its impact on local agriculture. -->
    <p>In the early 20th century, food terminals were the primary organizing facet of local agriculture.  Cleveland once hosted seven or eight terminals, relying on local farms to supply these bustling hubs.  Produce trains from the West Coast—called “fruit blocks”—traveled east with perishable goods that often had priority over passenger trains.  The Pennsylvania Railroad Fruit Auction & Sales Building in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, built around 1926, stretched 1,500 feet and spanned four city blocks.  Fruit and produce were unloaded from railcars and auctioned in the early morning so goods reached markets and restaurants by opening time.</p>
    <p>These terminals thrived thanks to the proximity of rail lines, but as refrigerated trucking became widespread, rail‑based produce distribution declined.  Many terminals were demolished or repurposed; only a handful of operations, like the Northern Ohio Food Terminal (now Sanson Company) and the Consumers Produce facility in Pittsburgh, remain today.  The history underscores how infrastructure shaped regional food economies and how transportation innovations can shift the balance between local and industrial supply chains.</p>
