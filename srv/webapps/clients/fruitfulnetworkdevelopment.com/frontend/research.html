      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Small Business Innovation Research (or SBIR) program is a U.S. government funding program, coordinated by the Small Business Administration, intended to help certain small businesses conduct research and development (R&amp;D). Funding is provided through contracts or grants. The recipient projects must have commercialization potential and meet specific U.S. government R&amp;D needs.</p>

            <li>Small farms are those with annual sales of agricultural products are less than $350,000 and between $350,000 and $999,999 for mid-size farms (hereafter: small farms)</li>
            <li>Small farms account for 90 percent of all U.S. farms and they play an important role in the agricultural sector. The viability and sustainability of small farms is important to the nation’s economy and to the stewardship of our biological and natural resources.</li>
            <li>While some small farms are located in urban areas, most small farms are located in rural areas, and these farms are critical to sustaining and strengthening the leadership and social fabric of rural communities.</li>
            <li>Emphasize how their project would contribute to the well-being of rural communities and institutions.</li>

      <h2>Open Source Novel Technology</h2>
      <p>FND's novel data technology is a system where local producers can digitally offer up their supply (in stock or expected) from the same data they manage their farm operations. This creates a shared data infrastructure that is just as seamless and efficient as what big agriculture uses in a top down model. This enables them to improve local economies, maintain a personal touch, and compete on product quality; without giving up any autonomy or control of their farming operations or their digital rights. There is a public demand for sustainably grown, local, healthy options and but the current system makes it financially and logistically hard to incorporate local producers. As a result, these farms under perform their industrial counterparts at about 10% per acre; just with respect to output of perishable crops that can't be planned for growth due to isolated suppliers, buyers and middle shops. Producers manage their website, inventory, POS, taxes, farm planning, and events through our desktop application. This aims to revolutionize the industry by creating the first refrigerated trucking and produce brokerage optimized for small agricultural producers at the same level as large industrial partners.</p>
