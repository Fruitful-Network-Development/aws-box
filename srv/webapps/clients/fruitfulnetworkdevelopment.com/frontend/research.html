        <div class="section-heading"><h2>Phase Proposals</h2></div>
        <p>Aligned proposals highlight the Mycite Framework’s ability to digitize local supply, synchronize with farm operations, and reduce duplicative data entry while protecting producer autonomy.</p>

      <section class="stacked-block">
        <div class="section-heading"><h2>Open Source Novel Technology</h2></div>
        <p>FND's novel data technology is a system where local producers can digitally offer up their supply (in stock or expected) from the same data they manage their farm operations. This creates a shared data infrastructure that is just as seamless and efficient as what big agriculture uses in a top down model. This enables them to improve local economies, maintain a personal touch, and compete on product quality; without giving up any autonomy or control of their farming operations or their digital rights. There is a public demand for sustainably grown, local, healthy options and but the current system makes it financially and logistically hard to incorporate local producers. As a result, these farms under perform their industrial counterparts at about 10% per acre; just with respect to output of perishable crops that can't be planned for growth due to isolated suppliers, buyers and middle shops. Producers manage their website, inventory, POS, taxes, farm planning, and events through our desktop application. This aims to revolutionize the industry by creating the first refrigerated trucking and produce brokerage optimized for small agricultural producers at the same level as large industrial partners.</p>
